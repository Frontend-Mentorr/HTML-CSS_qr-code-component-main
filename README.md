## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* This centers the children of .mainContainer vertically along the main axis */
  align-items: center; /* This centers the children of .mainContainer horizontally along the cross axis */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 90vh; /* This ensures that the body takes the full viewport height.The only way to centered vertically is to use this on main */
}

h2 {
  font-family: Outfit;
  font-weight: 700;
  width: 300px;
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  color: var(--color-dark-blue);
  transition-duration: 1200ms;
  transition-timing-function: ease;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying CSS animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
